Limitations
-----------

OpenStack Trove plugin deploys a dedicated RabbitMQ Cluster on Trove nodes for
for security reasons.
`Dedicated RabbitMQ <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-April/061759.html/>`_.

If the OpenStack Trove plugin is enabled for an environment, it is impossible
to assign Trove and Controller roles to the same node.

There is a Detach RabbitMQ plugin, which enable user to install RabbitMQ
on separate nodes. Detach RabbitMQ plugin role should not be used together
with Trove plugin role, User should ensure that:

 * Trove and RabbitMQ roles shoud not to be assigned to the same nodes

Trove Guest service on Tenant VM will comminicate with Trove RabbitMQ VIP
over SSL Connection only when the environment is confifured with SSL support.
